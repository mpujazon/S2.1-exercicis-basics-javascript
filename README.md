# Sprint 2.1 - Exercicis Basics Javascript

## 📄 Description

This project contains a series of practical exercises to learn and practice fundamental JavaScript concepts. Each file focuses on a specific topic, from modern ES6+ features to asynchronous programming.

## 💻 Technologies

- JavaScript (ES6+)
- HTML
- Node.js

## 📋 Requirements

- Node.js v14.0.0 or higher
- A modern web browser
- Code editor (VS Code recommended)

## 🛠️ Installation

Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/mpujazon/S2.1-exercicis-basics-javascript.git
```

Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd S2.1-exercicis-basics-javascript
```

## ▶️ Execution

### Option 1: Run in Browser
Open `index.html` in your browser and check the console to see the results.

### Option 2: Run with Node.js
Execute any file individually:
```bash
node 1.1-arrow-functions.js
```

## 💭 Difficulties
During these exercises I had trouble with asynchronous programming; it was a bit difficult to understand the main concepts, but I eventually succeeded.

## 🧠 What I've learned
- **Arrow Functions**: Modern function syntax and this binding
- **Ternary Operator**: Conditional expressions
- **Callbacks**: Functions as parameters
- **Rest & Spread Operators**: Working with variable arguments and array/object spreading
- **Array Transformations**: map, filter, reduce, and other methods
- **Array Loops**: forEach, for...of, and iteration patterns
- **Promises & Async/Await**: Asynchronous programming
